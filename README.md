# Introduction to Python

Hello, 

My colleagues and I have co-developed and co-instructed a series of Introduction to Python courses. This course was designed for those who have little to no experience working in Python. Our goal was to cover basic Python syntax as well as useful scientific applications.

Here I'm sharing Jupyter notebooks we used for our courses divided into two parts. 

The first Jupyter notebook covers:
1. Commenting
2. Identation
3. Assigning a Variable
4. Types
5. Data Structures
6. Functions

The second Jupyter notebook covers: (This will be added in the future)
1. Conditional Logic Statements
2. Loops
3. File Input and Output
4. NumPy
5. Pandas
6. Matplotlib

Although this is not all you need to use Python, I truly hope this will be your starting point to learn more.

Enjoy!
